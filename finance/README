Call «make» for creating build in subdirectory «build»

Required special tools for building:
  ssconvert (package gnumeric) to convert excel to csv
  csvtools (package csvtool) for extracting csv tables
  sqlite3 (package sqlite3) for database generation
  gawk (package gwak) GNU extended AWK

Installation of these packages in Ubuntu:
  sudo apt-get install gnumeric csvtool sqlite3 gawk

For hosting, do:
  call make
  configure webserver such as apache to expose subdirectory www
  webserver needs php with pdo and sqlite3 support

Directory Structure:

data:
  the original data as received from financial department

www:

Table Schema: see scripts/schema.sql

Table accounts: Account numbers

Table cost_units: Account numbers
  cost unit nr
  name

Table accountings: Accountings
  account nr
  cost unit nr
  year
  boa: budget(0) or accounting(1)
  amount


If you have the table, you can use SQL queries, e.g.:

Get a list of the difference of all the accounts in 2012 absolute and in percentage, sorted descending by the absolute difference:

echo "select (select name from cost_units where cost_unit=a.cost_unit),(select name from departments where cost_unit=a.cost_unit),(select name from accounts where account=a.account),a.amount,a.amount-b.amount as diff,100*(a.amount-b.amount)/b.amount as percentage from accountings as b left join accountings as a where b.year=2012 and b.boa=0 and a.year=2012 and a.boa=1 and b.cost_unit=a.cost_unit and b.account=a.account order by abs(a.amount-b.amount) desc;" | sqlite3 finance/build/finance.db
